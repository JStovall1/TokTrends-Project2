We used Kaggle databases for TikTok users and Twitter friends. Both of the datasets were in CSV format. One database is from within 2 weeks of when this project was done, while the other is 6 years old. We were intentional about this variation for the purposes of analysing for trends/comparisons, etc. in the future.

Some of the data cleaning tasks were dropping 'na' values from both tables. We also removed some column headings that weren't relevant (like date the account was opened). We also cleaned up information redundant information like getting rid of birthday since ther was also a column for age. We renamed a the column "Birth place" to "country" in order batch teh other dataframe. There were some numeric values that were saved as strings and contained commas. We dopped the commas and converted these columns to integers formatted to have whole numbers for ease of joining and comparing data.

There are many different ways to perform further analysis on the chosen datasets. One could use the 'Political Party' column for example to find correlations between social media usage and political views. There could also be age and gender comparisons based on other columns. An interesting avenue could also be comparing data between differing countries. The country colum allows for us to drop this data into a relational database. However, there are enough specific columns withiin each table to just as easily use a non-relational database long Mongo to extract interesting information as well.
